# CMICR-Terraria-mod
Calamity Malice Items Crafting Recipes (CMICR), a mod for Terraria using tModLoader
This mod does a simple thing: it adds crafting recipes for items that can be obtained only when malice mode is enabled. These items are made from 6 treasure bags, a lore item and an expert mode item of each boss respectively with a few exceptions.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The world must be in expert mode because of the ingredients in the recipes. Use this mod only if you really struggle with the bosses on the malice mod to avoid the feeling of cheesing the progression too much.

Crafting recipes exceptions:
-Mechanical bosses: 6 treasure bags, lore item and 10 souls respectively

-Sentinels of the Devourer: 6 treasure bags and 1 material drop respectively (dark plasma from the Void, twisting nether from Signus and armored shell from the Storm Weaver)

Thatâ€™s it, have fun!
